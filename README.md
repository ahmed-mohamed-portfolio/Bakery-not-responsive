Peace be upon you, guys!
How are you all doing? I hope everything’s good 💜

Today we have Assignment 3: Bakery 🥖
🔗 Link: http://www.engage.veented.com/bakery/

Requirements:
🔴 We’ll build the first three sections [Home, Who we are, Our Location] using display: inline-block.
🔴 The rest of the website will be done using float.
🔴 There’s a small rectangle on the side that stays fixed when scrolling — we don’t need to build that.

As usual, here are some hints to help you ✨
1️⃣ When you use display: inline-block, there’s a property that gives you more control over the element: vertical-align. Try searching about it.
2️⃣ When you use float, don’t forget to use clear right after it. (Pay attention that it should come after the last floated element, right before the parent closing tag).
3️⃣ For icons, you can temporarily add them as <img> until we learn a better method.

Deadline: Monday, 24/3 at 10 PM
